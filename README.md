# DigitalSystemDesign
## What is this?

 - This is my GitHub repository to share my contributions  to the course at the Stevens Institute of Technology, class [CPE-487: Digital System Design](https://sites.google.com/view/ece487), as taught by [Dr. Kevin Lu](https://web.stevens.edu/facultyprofile/?id=2081). 
 - You can find my work, organized by folders. Coursework that was not significantly modified was omitted. Original assignments/coursework can be found [here](https://github.com/kevinwlu/dsd). 
## Projects
 - 1ar: A binary-hexadecimal and binary-decimal converter. Only works 1-way. 
 - finalprojectrestart: A basic audio buzzer alarm. The frequency is hardcoded, but can be easily modified. Looking to make this play actual audio files.
